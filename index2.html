				<p> Throughout our lives we are tasked with finding a path that will eventually take us to the places we want to go. Regardless of ones path to get there we must overcome obstacles that are meant to derail us. At <strong>Strive </strong>we look to ourselves as the starting point for progressing in the vary direction we want to propell towards.
				We make this happen by attacking each step in getting to our goals with a tenacity unable to be broken. By extreme focus we challenge our mind and our bodies to dismantle the status quoe and turn ourselves into the worlds next great generation of creative thinkers. What would a personalized learning evironment look like? The interesting part is that it would all be different. No one goal is the same so in that aspect itself you are defining how you want to go about learning.
			<h3>Who is Strive?</h3>
				<p>The best part about <strong>Strive</strong> is that it's not limited to those who created it. We bring different creative minds into one place and collaborate just because its FUN!! Even you could be part of Strive, all you have to do is have a willingness to learn and create. But who founded Strive? </p>
			<h3><strong>Silas Stokes</h3>

					<p>Silas has been what we call a "creative" ever since he was a small child. He has a contagious drive to learn and explore different possibilities in all aspects of his life. He is a proficient musician and producer, and very easy to collaborate with. He was one of the initial founders of Strive and without him, it would never have gotten off the white board.</p>
			<h3><strong>Matt Brown</strong></h3>

					<p>Matt started learning how to throw a football when he was 8, he learned how to play guitar when he was 14, and now he's 20 and learning how to code. He is a proficient song-writer and has grown to love the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
						<div>Together along with the helps of Northwest Creatives like, Dallen Pace (also a co-founder), Hunter Soto, Daniel Lazar, Adamm and Josh from Skye Rise and many others, Strive has now become a sanctuary to express yourself.</div>
