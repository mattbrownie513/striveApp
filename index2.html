			<p> Throughout our lives we are tasked with finding a path that will eventually take us to the places we want to go. Regardless of ones path to get there we must overcome obstacles that are meant to derail us. At <em>Strive</em> we look to ourselves as the starting point for progressing in the vary direction we want to propell towards. We make this happen by attacking each step in getting to our goals with a tenacity unable to be broken. By extreme focus we challenge our mind and our bodies to dismantle the status quoe and turn ourselves into the worlds next great generation of creative thinkers. What would a personalized learning evironment look like? The interesting part is that it would all be different. No one goal is the same so in that aspect itself you are defining how you want to go about learning.
